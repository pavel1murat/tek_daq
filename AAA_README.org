# to tead a Tek scope using PyVISA:

* General: 

  download linux-gpib , start from https://linux-gpib.sourceforge.io/

  - it took a couple of edits - smth had changed in the call signatures

  go to /projects/products/linux-gpib-4.2.0 and build and install linux-gpib,
  both kernel and user parts

  modprobe ni_usb_gpib


  - after that, can start talking to GPIB bus over USB-to-GPIB cable ($170 on eBay)

  - VISA_Infiniium - initial version by Katie, tek_daq supercedes it

* Development: 

  <2019-04-24 Wed> : will add PyQT-based interface
  <2019-04-23 Tue> : add command line parameter parsing, by default write .txt to /dev/null
